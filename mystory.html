    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Gonzalo Diamend. I was born in January 1992 in Buenos Aires. My parents are Sandra and Fredy, and I have a sister named Victoria. I had a very happy childhood marked by the tough economic situation of Argentina in the 90s.
      Since I was a child, I was interested in everything related to computers. The first game I had in my hands was the World Cup 1998. I was always very curious but did not feel that it was my vocation, I believed it was a hobby. 
      In 2009, when I finished my studies, the twists of fate brought me to the place where it all began. I studied journalism, did various audiovisual projects, but since I started my first IT job in 2010, I knew this was what I wanted to do.
      I am currently married to Antonella, and we live in Madrid with our dog Sheldon. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I have worked as a software engineer for the past 5 years, participating in a variety of projects, including web, mobile, and desktop applications.</p>
    
    <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
    <p>Passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. Committed to making a positive impact through technology. I have worked in quality in different technology companies. Since then, I have incorporated knowledge about testing and all the areas related to the product development cycle. I am passionate about what I do, I really enjoy the day-to-day in a software company.
    
      I have experience in all the quality cycles that make up the validation of new software: From the planning stage, with the creation of a test strategy, the formation of test cases, and the subsequent test plans. Then in the product validation stage with the different instances that are carried out: Regression test, Smoke test, bug fixing, or User Acceptance test. I have also gained knowledge in metrics and data analysis due to my leadership experience. I also have experience in automated testing: I have used various tools such as Puppeteer, Selenium, or Cypress to perform scripts for different projects. I also had the opportunity to perform testing on mobile devices or tablets using Android and iOS.
      I spend a lot of time training in new technologies. I am aware that in the competitive industry we are in, we need to be updated with the latest trends in terms of new tools to streamline and be able to do a job with superior quality.</p>
