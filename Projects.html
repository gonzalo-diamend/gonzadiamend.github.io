    <h2>Rootstrap (2022 - Present)</h2>
    <p>I am working as a QA Automation Lead for the quality control team of the company. I am in charge of leading new processes around automation and non-functional testing. I work leading 8 automation engineers and advising another 10 engineers on their transition path from manual testing to automation. I was in charge of creating different paths for automation, API testing, and performance testing. I am working on all the steps of the Automation strategy of any project and how to implement it. I create different content such as articles, case studies, or workshops to present our work at Rootstrap. I have also been involved in different meetings with clients in order to secure new projects for the company.</p>
    
    <h2>Opera (2022)</h2>
    <p>I worked as a QA Automation consultant for Opera in Sweden, specifically in Linkoping. I have been supporting the automation framework and all the tools the company used for automation testing. I also suggested different changes in the way the company does all the work. Other tasks I have performed are related to manual processes and how the quality control teams create regressions for different types of tests.</p>
    
    <h2>Tienda Mia (2021-2022)</h2>
    <p>I worked as a Team Leader in the company's QA Automation team. I was in charge of creating all the automated scripts for the team and planning new releases. This includes E2E and Post regression tests. I also created documents related to automation strategy, framework selection, and automation roadmap. I created documentation related to environment setup.
      I have been using Cypress as a framework and JavaScript as a coding language. We use Jira as a tracker and gitlab as a version control system. I worked from a Windows system and we are configuring the environment with a combination of Linux and Windows for Jenkins runs. I was responsible for 100% of the project's Automation design, either with coding or management. I led a team with two other QA Automations. My time was fully devoted to automation tasks. Another task I was assigned to was recruiting where I was interviewing candidates, both culturally and technically.</p>

I also created documents related to automation strategy, framework selection, and the project roadmap. On the other hand, I created documentation related to installing the framework on a virtual machine.

    <h2>Appdirect (2017-2020)</h2>
    <p>I served as QA Automation in a scrum team for assisted sales projects for the company and I am in charge of these tasks:
      - Automation and validation of new features
      - Implementation of technical improvements
      - Bug fixing
      - UAT demo
      - Automation of Pre and Post smoke tests

      The tools at the Automation level we currently use are linked to UI automation with JavaScript. The Framework used is based on Puppeteer, NodeJS, and JEST. All automations are linked to the Jenkins pipeline to maintain the idea of continuous improvement.
      
      In the company, I have also served as a Backup of the channel lead in the Vodafone project carrying out the comprehensive tests of the new marketplaces that are added in the regressions. Requirements are reviewed with the client, understanding meetings are coordinated, test cases are created, and testing begins in pre-environments before merging into the Test environment and later in production. In manual testing we use: Sequel PRO as a database, POSTMAN for API testing, JIRA for defect creation, Test Rail for test plan and test cases creation. On the other hand, for new requirements, tests are carried out using GitHub to review requirements and Orchard for creating new environments with the PRs.</p>
  
    <h2>Cognizant (2014-2017)</h2>
    <p>During my time at Cognizant, I had the opportunity to progress a lot in my roles. I got to work on two clients: My first project in the company was the galaxy project at Banco Galicia. My job consisted of performing transactional tests involving the migration of bank accounts to SAP. The tools I use are QC Quality Center, SAP GUI, mainframe platforms, and different bank usage pages such as Homebanking, Galicia Office, or Fonobanco. 
      Tests are performed in different environments and in different modalities. The releases are classic of the agile testing modality. Then I got to work at YPF as a QA Lead where I led the team in the migration of the company's auction system, with both internal and external teams</p>
  
    <h2>CMD Grupo Clarin (2011-2014)</h2>
    <p>My experience at CMD was highly rewarding as I met a great group of people who helped me progress both personally and professionally. In this job, I had the role of test leader in the projects: TN and la Gente, Todo Noticias, El Trece TV, Ciudad, and Fashion Tv. My task was to organize and functionally execute the different pages in a beta environment as well as ensure that they function correctly in production. I also took care of validating the new versions that come out and the possible bug fixing that may occur later. During this stage, the tasks I performed were: Logging Defects (JIRA); Writing Scenarios, TCers, and Test Scripts; Checking in SQL of the different pages. Mobile testing of pre-production environments with Android, Symbian, Blackberry, and iOS. Production testing on Ipad and Android tablet. E-Commerce testing with Mercado Pago on the Club Cupón page.
      During 2013 I was in charge of the coordination and planning of the different tests of the TN redesign, released to production on August 3 of that year and which was awarded numerous prizes. In my role as test leader, I had a team of two people under my charge, working alongside me on these projects. Tests have been carried out with E-Commerce platforms such as MercadoPago. I have also acquired knowledge in SEO, DAX, and Google Analytics. </p>
